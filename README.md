**Description**

First mobile application made with React Native and Expo. Onboarding screens as `SignUp`, `LogIn` and `ForgotPassword` are only seen when `userToken` is not set. On button 'log in' click, the state is changed and now rest of the screens are seen.
In application are used stack and tab navigations.
